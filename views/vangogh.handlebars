              <span class="font-weight-bold">Vincent Willem van Gogh</span> was a Dutch painter who is among the most famous and influential painters in the history of Western art.
              He was not commercially successful during his lifetime and his life was marked by years of mental illness and poverty. He died by suicide at age 37.

            <p>
              He became famous after his death and is a figure commonly used to illustrate the trope of the "tortured artist."

          Born into an upper-middle class family, Van Gogh drew as a child, but didn't become an artist until he was 27 (1881). His younger brother, Theo, supported him financially and the two famously kept a long correspondence by letter. His early works were mostly still life and depictions of peasant laborers, with little to no use of bright, vivid colors for which he would be known (see <span class="p-name">The Potato Eaters</span>, 1885 for example of his early work).

      In 1886, he moved to Paris and developed his style that he would be known for today, a brighter and bolder palette. After 2 years, he moved to Arles in Southern France and there, he had one of his most prolific periods, completing 200 oil paintings alone. Paul Gaugin, his friend and artist, came to visit Van Gogh in Arles. As their relationship began to deteriorate and suffering from a psychotic episode, Van Gogh severed his left ear.

      Van Gogh's mental health became progressively worse and he spent time in a psychiatric hospital, where he continued to paint. Being confined to the clinic resulted in limited subject matter, so Van Gogh turned to painting his interpretations of other artist's paintings (e.g. <span class="p-name">Prisoners' Round (after Gustave Doré)</span>, 1890).
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving the clinic in 1890, Van Gogh spent the final months of his life in Auvers-sur-Oise, an artists' village near Paris. There, he made new friends and threw himself into painting. However, with his mental illness and uncertainty of his future, Van Gogh ultimately shot himself in the chest with a pistol.
